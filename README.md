#Welcome to Auth0#

We have been chatting about the idea of `authentication` and `authorization` for the past couple of days. This is a deep and complex topic, and you, being a good developer, should want to stand on the shoulders of giants to tackle this seemingly simple, yet complex problem.

## Objectives

- Integrate Auth0 with your favorite frontend framework

## Requirements

- Create an account [here](https://auth0.com).
- follow along with a tutorial to create a simple front end application.

### Explorer Mode

- [x] Using either React or Vue, create a new front-end application that uses Auth0 as the user provider. No backend is needed for this.
- [ ] Display the name, or email, and the user Id to the user after they log in.

#### Tips:

- Here is the sample code we used in class [https://github.com/mdewey/PlacesIHaveBeen](https://github.com/mdewey/PlacesIHaveBeen)
- For React go [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react)
- For Vue go [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vuejs)
- The implementations in the different frameworks are about 90% the same.
- Be sure to include the router libraries for the project you create. I would suggest starting here and creating threes pages/components: `home`, `callback`, and `dashboard`

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Add User Authenication to StackOverflow

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Work on your capstone
